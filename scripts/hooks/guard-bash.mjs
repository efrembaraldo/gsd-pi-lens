 * scripts/hooks/guard-bash.mjs (#2699, refs umbrella #2697)
 *
 * PreToolUse hook for the Bash tool. Mechanically enforces four
 * non-negotiables that previously lived only as prose in CLAUDE.md and the
 * fixer/reviewer playbooks -- a fixer ran `git stash` on 2026-09-07 (the
 * #2686 lane) and two review probes wrote into the real `~/.pi-lens` on
 * 2026-09-02 (#2506), both rules a hook can catch that prose could not:
 *
 *   - `git stash` in any form (CLAUDE.md non-negotiable)
 *   - `git reset --soft origin/<branch>` / `git reset --hard <anything>`
 *   - a HAND-typed `git worktree remove` with two force flags (the
 *     sanctioned removal is `node scripts/prune-agent-worktrees.mjs`,
 *     liveness-checked, or unlock + single force)
 *   - an unpinned `node` probe that LOADS built runtime code from clients/
 *     or dist/ (not merely a payload that mentions "clients/" in passing --
 *     review round 2 F5) with no PI_LENS_HOME pin (AGENTS.md "Probe
 *     hygiene")
 *
 * ## Contract source
 *
 * Fetched https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks (docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/
 * claude-code/hooks 301-redirects there) on 2026-09-07. A PreToolUse hook
 * receives this on stdin:
 *   { session_id, transcript_path, cwd, permission_mode, hook_event_name,
 *     tool_name, tool_input, tool_use_id, ... }
 * For the Bash tool, `tool_input = { command: string, ... }`. A hook denies
 * the call in one of two ways: (a) exit code 2 with the reason written to
 * stderr, or (b) exit 0 and print
 * `{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse","permissionDecision":
 * "deny","permissionDecisionReason":"..."}}` to stdout. This script uses
 * (a) -- the issue's own wording ("exit 2 with a one-line teaching message")
 * names it, and it is the simpler of the two to test (one exit code, one
 * stream, no JSON-shape drift risk on stdout).
 *
 * ## Shape: subtract the inert regions, THEN tokenize (review round 3)
 *
 * Round 2 delimited a `$( … )` span with a standalone paren/quote counter
 * that ran THROUGH heredoc bodies. One unbalanced `)` in prose therefore
 * closed the span early and the rest of a PR description leaked into the
 * top-level command scan (round 2's own PR body was denied by its own
 * hook). The lesson is structural, not a missing case: span extents and
 * heredoc bodies cannot be decided by two separate scanners.
 *
 * So there is now exactly ONE region pass, {@link lexRegions}, which is
 * simultaneously quote-, comment-, heredoc- and substitution-aware and
 * calls ITSELF to find a nested span's extent. It returns
 *
 *   - `retained`: the text left after every INERT region is subtracted, and
 *   - a flat list of every command-substitution body at any depth,
 *
 * and only then does {@link splitSegments} split on operators (it has to
 * know about quotes and nothing else, because substitutions, heredoc
 * bodies and comments are already gone). A stray `)`/backtick inside a
 * heredoc body is unreachable by construction rather than special-cased.
 *
 * The regions are classified from REAL bash, empirically -- every
 * (region kind × nesting context) cell of the state space was run through
 * `bash -c` with a side-effecting stand-in for the forbidden command, and
 * the cell's verdict is whether the side effect happened. The full table,
 * with the fixture id that pins each cell, is in the PR body and in
 * `tests/scripts/guard-bash-hook.test.ts`'s `LEXER_STATE_SPACE`. The three
 * results that are easy to get backwards from reading code alone:
 *
 *   - A heredoc body with a QUOTED delimiter (`<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"`,
 *     `<<\EOF`) is inert in full and is dropped.
 *   - A heredoc body with an UNQUOTED delimiter (`<<EOF`) is NOT inert:
 *     bash still expands `$( … )` and backticks inside it, so
 *     `cat <<EOF` / `$(git stash)` / `EOF` really runs it. Its body text is
 *     dropped but its substitutions are recursed into.
 *   - Quotes and `#` are LITERAL inside any heredoc body -- so
 *     `'$(git stash)'` and `# $(git stash)` on a body line both still run.
 *
 * A single-quoted span is deliberately NOT subtracted. It is inert for
 * operator splitting, expansion, and comment/heredoc recognition, but it
 * still takes part in WORD formation: `git 'stash'` and `'git' stash` both
 * really run `git stash`. It is retained as literal word text instead, and
 * {@link splitWords} strips the quotes when fusing the word.
 *
 * ## Handled
 *
 * `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, `&`, `(`, `)`, newline as segment separators;
 * single/double-quoted spans as opaque fused words; `$( … )` and backtick
 * spans, recursively (including a `\``-escaped backtick span nested inside
 * a backtick span, which bash does execute); `<<`/`<<-` heredocs with a
 * quoted, bare, or backslash-escaped delimiter, `<<-`'s leading-tab strip,
 * and a `\r` before the delimiter's newline (a CRLF command whose
 * terminator would otherwise never match, swallowing every later command);
 * `<<<` here-strings (content inert, substitutions live); `#` comments,
 * recognized only at a word start the way bash does (`a#b` is not a
 * comment); backslash-newline line continuation; a leading `{`
 * command-group brace and `command`/`exec`/`env`/`sudo`/`time` runner
 * prefixes; `export VAR=val` persisted forward to later segments of the
 * same scan; a command word resolved by its final path segment
 * (`/usr/bin/git` == `./git` == `git`); leading `FOO=bar` env assignments
 * and `-c <k>=<v>` / `-C <dir>` git global options; a backslash-escaped
 * command word (`\g\i\t stash`, which bash runs).
 *
 * ## NOT handled (accepted; no test claims otherwise)
 *
 *   - `eval "…"`, `bash -c "…"` / `sh -c "…"`, `xargs git stash`: the
 *     nested string or spawned argv is opaque to any text scan.
 *   - A runner prefix carrying its OWN options -- `sudo -u root git stash`,
 *     `timeout 30 git stash`, `nice -n 10 git stash`, `stdbuf -o0 …`. Only
 *     the bare prefix forms above are stripped; a prefix followed by a
 *     flag stops the search (the flag becomes the command word and matches
 *     no rule).
 *   - A command word assembled by expansion (`git st$(echo a)sh`,
 *     `${G} stash`, `$(which git) stash`): no static text scan can resolve
 *     a runtime-computed word.
 *   - `require(mod)` with a variable specifier, for the probe rule.
 *
 * These are documented blind spots, not silent ones: the guard's threat
 * model is an agent's own slip, not a party deliberately hiding a command
 * from it.
 *
 * Never throws: any stdin/JSON/classification failure degrades to "allow"
 * (exit 0) rather than blocking every Bash call in the session -- a crashed
 * hook must never be the thing that blocks the tool. That is also what
 * bounds recursion: {@link lexRegions} nests once per nested span, and a
 * pathologically deep input raises RangeError, which {@link run} catches
 * and allows. (Round 2 capped nesting at depth 8, which silently ALLOWED
 * anything nested deeper; the cap is deleted rather than raised.)
