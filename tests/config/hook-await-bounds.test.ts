/**
 * #2523 AC1: no NEW unbounded `await` on a pi hook path, and no NEW
 * hand-rolled timeout race anywhere in the shipped tree.
 *
 * ## The defect this guards
 *
 * `wrapSessionEventHandler` (`clients/session-event-guard.ts`) absorbs a
 * stale-ctx throw and adds NO deadline and NO abort. Every bound in the
 * codebase lived at a LEAF — a spawn timeout, an LSP wait — so a dependency
 * that wedged BEFORE reaching the leaf was unreachable by all of them.
 * #2523's probes against the real handlers measured the consequence: a wedged
 * dependency on `turn_end` never returned (400 000 ms harness ceiling), and
 * with the ambient abort fired at t=2 s exactly as `index.ts` wires it,
 * `still-blocked after 30011ms` — Escape does not release the hook.
 *
 * `bounded()` (`clients/deadline-utils.ts`) is the fix primitive: it takes
 * BOTH bounds and its type refuses one without the other. This sweep is what
 * makes the primitive load-bearing rather than optional.
 *
 * ## Two families, one table
 *
 * 1. **`hook-await`** — every `await` in `index.ts`, `clients/runtime-*.ts`,
 *    `mcp/server.ts` and `clients/mcp/session.ts`, the four places a
 *    registered hook handler and its direct deps live. Wrapped in
 *    `bounded()`, or written down here.
 * 2. **`hand-rolled-race`** — every `Promise.race([...])` whose own arms
 *    include a `setTimeout` or an `AbortSignal.timeout`, anywhere in
 *    `clients/`, `index.ts`, `mcp/` or `tools/`, outside `deadline-utils.ts`
 *    itself. `bounded()` must become THE one bound primitive rather than a
 *    new sibling of the scattered idioms, so a NEW hand-rolled race is
 *    forbidden from today even though the existing ones are not migrated in
 *    this slice.
 *
 * ## Why the await scan over-includes, deliberately
 *
 * Not every `await` in those four groups is hook-reachable: a slash command
 * in `index.ts` and an MCP tool-request handler in `mcp/server.ts` are not. A
 * real reachability walk was considered and rejected for slice 1.
 * `tests/support/session-state-scan.ts` already documents why an unrestricted
 * call-graph walk answers a different question ("walking EVERY call out of
 * `handleSessionStart` would drag in most of the codebase"), and a walk that
 * follows only SOME edges — bare calls but not methods, not callbacks, not
 * dynamic imports — produces false NEGATIVES, which for a guard is the
 * direction that fails silently.
 *
 * So the scan over-includes WITHIN the files it walks, and the table records
 * the judgement. Each entry names WHICH hook's budget the await spends, or
 * says that none applies and why. That is a fact a reviewer can check against
 * the source; a reachability heuristic's silence is not.
 *
 * ## The walked file set, and the widening slice 2 added
 *
 * Round 1's header claimed "over-inclusion is the safe direction for a guard"
 * without saying that the FILE SET was a partial walk of its own (#2530 review
 * F6): hook work reached through a helper MODULE left the scan's view
 * entirely. Slice 2's first attempt at closing that listed SIX module names by
 * hand — which is defect shape 34, a guard that enumerates spellings. The
 * reviewer planted 18 unbounded awaits in `clients/observed-mutation.ts` and
 * 148 in `clients/lsp/index.ts` — modules that same PR labelled hook-reached —
 * and the sweep stayed green (#2557 review F4).
 *
 * The set is now DERIVED from the import graph: {@link hookHelperModules}
 * resolves every relative specifier in the four hook-handler groups and
 * returns what they reach in ONE hop. That is **202** modules today, holding
 * **1255** unbounded awaits, against the six hand-picked modules' 100 — and
 * the hand-picked list included `clients/dispatch/dispatcher.ts`, which is not
 * even a one-hop import (it is reached through `clients/dispatch/
 * integration.ts`), so it was both under- and mis-inclusive.
 *
 * {@link HELPER_UNBOUNDED} pins every one of those modules that holds at least
 * one, exactly, through the kit's own `auditSymbolCounts`. Zero-count modules
 * are not listed and do not need to be: one gaining an await appears in the
 * measured map and fails as an unaccounted entry. The granularity is
 * per-MODULE rather than per-occurrence deliberately — 1255 `EXEMPT_SITES`
 * entries whose `reason` would all read "slice 3 owns bounding this" is the
 * hand-maintained mirror AGENTS.md's single-source rule exists to prevent —
 * and the trade is stated in {@link SWEEP_HEURISTIC_LIMITS}: a count cannot
 * tell "bounded one, added one" from "changed nothing". The table shrinks to
 * nothing as #2523 threads the hook signal into the deps types, which is the
 * structural answer a file list only approximates.
 *
 * ## A third family: every `bounded()` call, and where its signal comes from
 *
 * `bounded()`'s `signal` is a REQUIRED property typed `AbortSignal |
 * undefined` — the key must be written, so a deadline-only call cannot
 * compile, but a seam holding an optional signal may pass it straight through
 * and then run on ONE live bound whenever the caller genuinely had none.
 * {@link BOUNDED_CALL_SITES} registers every shipped call with the provenance
 * of its signal, so that set cannot grow without someone writing down why. It
 * replaces round 1's `NEVER_ABORTED` sentinel, which enumerated the same fact
 * by making callers name a constant — a SECOND concept for behaviour
 * `bounded()` already had, on an issue whose premise is that one primitive
 * replaces the private copies (#2557 review F2).
 *
 * ## The table is a BASELINE, deliberately
 *
 * Every entry below is today's tree, owned by `#2523 slice 2` — the slice
 * that actually bounds these awaits and folds the hand-rolled races into
 * `bounded()` (AC3-AC8). Slice 1 changes no hook's behavior. The value
 * shipped here is the RATCHET: entry N+1 cannot be added silently. #2523 says
 * it in as many words — "slice 1's red output is the worklist".
 *
 * Keys are content-derived, never line numbers (#2487): a line inserted
 * elsewhere in `index.ts` must not re-key 29 exemptions, and a textual merge
 * of two such re-keys can land a WRONG number with no conflict marker. The
 * key IS `stableOccurrenceKey` — the kit's own function over the RAW lines —
 * with one neighbourhood suffix; see {@link awaitOccurrenceKey} for what that
 * suffix buys and what it costs.

 *   shows. Every `hand-rolled-race` entry is `off-hook` unless the race sits
 *   on a hook path.
 * - `"unbudgeted-hook"` — reachable from a registered hook that #2523's
 *   contract gives no wall budget (`tool_call`, `resources_discover`,
 *   `message_end`). Recorded as a gap, not papered over with a number nobody

 * been threaded into the deps type that reaches it, which is #2523 AC4 and has
 * not landed. Repeating that sentence 75 times with a module name substituted

/**
 * Every one-hop helper module holding at least one unbounded await, and how
 * many (#2557 review F4).
 *
 * The SET is derived by {@link hookHelperModules} from the import graph, never
 * spelled — see this file's header for what the hand-written six-name list
 * missed. Modules measuring ZERO are deliberately absent: one that gains an
 * await appears in the measured map and fails as an unaccounted entry, so
 * listing 127 zeroes would add churn without adding a guard.
 *
 * Pinned through `auditSymbolCounts`, the kit's own file-count mechanism
 * (#1817), rather than a bespoke comparison — same machinery the session-state
 * sweep pins ~72 files with.
 *
 * Round-3 deltas (2026-09-03), all measured, none hand-picked:
 *
 * - `clients/actionable-warnings.ts` 12 → 14. Review F-A's fix adds an outer
 *   `await withDeadline(inner, …)` deadline-only cap around the existing
 *   `await bounded(…)` call in `boundedLspCall`, so the loop's own shrinking
 *   residual budget stops reaching the ledger as a false
 *   `hook-await-exceeded`. `isBoundedAwait` only recognizes the literal
 *   `bounded(` call head (by design — see its own doc comment on why
 *   `withDeadline` was deliberately dropped from that list in round 1), so
 *   the new deadline-only await is honestly unbounded by this heuristic even
 *   though it composes correctly with the still-present `bounded()` call.
 * - `clients/formatters.ts` 118 → 115, from `origin/master`'s #2514
 *   (`05df8268`..`4cd8bdb6`, folding formatters' tool-bin walkers onto one
 *   ceilinged walker), merged into this branch — not a change this PR made.
 * - Eight modules REMOVED entirely (their one-hop edge was ONLY an `import
 *   type`, per the friction fix above): `clients/biome-client.ts` (9),
 *   `clients/complexity-client.ts` (1), `clients/dependency-checker.ts` (21),
 *   `clients/jscpd-client.ts` (4), `clients/knip-client.ts` (6),
 *   `clients/lsp/client.ts` (75), `clients/opengrep-client.ts` (2),
 *   `clients/ruff-client.ts` (6) — 8 modules, 124 awaits, measured with
 *   `scripts/.probe-measure-helpers.mjs` (not committed) against this
 *   branch's `hookHelperModules`. Every one of these is a linter/analyzer
 *   CLIENT class only reached from a hook handler for its exported TYPE
 *   (`clients/runtime-turn.ts`'s `import type { DependencyChecker,
 *   MadgeBatchStats } from "./dependency-checker.js"`, confirmed by hand for
 *   this entry); the actual VALUE-level construction is `bootstrap.ts`'s
 *   dynamic `await import(...)` inside `requestBootstrapClients`, which is
 *   TWO hops from a hook handler (hook handler → `bootstrap.ts` →
 *   the client) and correctly outside the one-hop walk. 202 modules / 1255
 *   awaits (the PR's round-1 baseline) is now 190 modules / 1130 awaits.
